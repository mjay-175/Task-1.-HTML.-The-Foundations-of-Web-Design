Timeline App â€“ Stage 1

This is the first stage of my Timeline App project.

What's included:
- A header with a logo and a theme toggle button (the toggle doesn't do anything yet, just a placeholder for now)
- A nav section where I'll eventually add filters
- A main section with an empty timeline (`<section id="timeline">`) where events will go later
- An empty modal div for future pop-ups
- Tried to stick to semantic HTML using tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<figure>` where it made sense
